Description: An integrated framework for analyzing microbiome data from the female
    genital tract (FGT). This package unifies specialized tools (dada2, phyloseq,
    speciateIT, VALENCIA, and VIRGO) within a cohesive framework that handles both
    amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data. Built on TreeSummarizedExperiment
    with tidyverse design principles, it provides specialized functionality for
    FGT microbiome research including community state typing and multi-omics integration.
