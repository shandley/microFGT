Description: An integrated framework for analyzing microbiome data from the female
    genital tract (FGT). This package unifies specialized tools within a cohesive
    framework that handles both amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data. Built on 
    TreeSummarizedExperiment with efficient data structures, it provides specialized
    functionality for FGT microbiome research including taxonomic analysis and 
    transformation functions.
