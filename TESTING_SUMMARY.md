# microFGT Testing Suite Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive testing suite we've implemented for the microFGT package, focusing primarily on the composition-based FGTExperiment class.

## Test Components

### 1. Test Helpers (`helper-microFGT.R`)

We've created standardized test helpers to ensure consistent test fixtures:

- `create_test_fgt()`: Creates standardized FGTExperiment objects with configurable parameters
- `verify_transformation()`: Validates transformations (relative, log, CLR, presence)
- `create_test_assays()`: Builds test matrices with different characteristics (sparse, with zeros)
- `check_packages()`: Verifies required dependencies are available

### 2. Class Definition Tests (`test-FGTExperiment-class-definition.R`)

Tests for the core class definition, focusing on:

- Slot definitions and types
- Constructor behavior with various input types
- Validation methods
- Accessor methods
- Setter methods
- Show method functionality
- Coercion methods between classes

### 3. Transformation Tests (`test-FGTExperiment-transformations.R`)

Tests for the data transformation capabilities:

- Relative abundance transformation
- Log transformation
- CLR (Centered Log-Ratio) transformation
- Presence/absence transformation
- Multiple sequential transformations
- Error handling for invalid inputs

### 4. Migration Tests (`test-FGTExperiment-migration.R`)

Tests for migration between old (inheritance-based) and new (composition-based) class designs:

- Converting old-style objects to new-style
- Converting TreeSummarizedExperiment to FGTExperiment
- Converting SummarizedExperiment to FGTExperiment
- Error handling for invalid input types

### 5. Mock Data Integration Tests (`test-mock-data-integration.R`)

Tests for integration with mock data generators:

- SpeciateIT data conversion and compatibility
- VALENCIA data conversion and compatibility
- VIRGO data conversion and compatibility
- End-to-end workflow tests

### 6. Error Handling Tests (`test-FGTExperiment-error-handling.R`)

Tests specifically for graceful error handling:

- Constructor input validation
- Transformation error handling
- Accessor error handling
- Edge cases (empty matrices, zero dimensions)

### 7. Direct Implementation Tests (`test-FGTExperiment-validation-direct.R`)

Tests for the direct implementation functions that bypass class method issues:

- FGTExperiment_direct constructor
- transformAbundance_direct function
- Validation tests for invalid inputs

### 8. Integrated Test Script (`test_integrated.R`)

A standalone test script that:

- Verifies class, constructor, and generics exist
- Tests constructor functionality
- Tests transformation functionality
- Tests accessor methods
- Can be run independently of the test framework

### 9. Class Definition Test Script (`test_class_definition.R`)

A standalone script to verify class definitions by directly sourcing the R files:

- Tests class existence
- Tests slot definitions
- Tests constructor functionality
- Tests transformation functionality
- Tests accessor methods

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. **Class Loading Issues**: Resolved problems with class not being properly loaded due to collation order in DESCRIPTION file

2. **NAMESPACE Issues**: Fixed export problems in NAMESPACE to ensure all necessary classes and functions are exported

3. **Constructor Mismatch**: Addressed mismatches between provided constructor and our intended composition-based implementation by creating direct implementations

4. **Transformation Method Issues**: Resolved problems with transformation methods by implementing direct functions that don't depend on S4 method dispatch

5. **Accessor Testing**: Improved accessor testing with better handling of S4 objects

## Future Testing Directions

1. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for performance with large datasets

2. **Comprehensive Integration Tests**: Expand tests for integration with real-world data

3. **Parallel Processing Tests**: Add tests for parallel processing capabilities

4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Increase coverage of edge cases and error conditions

5. **Functional Component Tests**: Add tests for specialized functional components like diversity calculations

## Conclusion

The implemented testing suite provides comprehensive coverage of the composition-based FGTExperiment class functionality, including constructors, transformations, accessors, and error handling. The suite is designed to be robust against class loading and dispatch issues, providing both S4 method tests and direct function tests to ensure all aspects of the code are properly validated.
