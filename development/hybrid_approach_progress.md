# Hybrid Approach Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks our progress in implementing the hybrid approach for the microFGT package, which combines a minimal S4 class layer with function-centric design and S3 methods for visualization.

## Completed Components

### Core S4 Class Layer
- [x] Simplified `FGTExperiment` class definition
- [x] Basic constructor that extends TreeSummarizedExperiment
- [x] Essential accessor methods

### Function-Based Design
- [x] Transformation functions (`transform_functions.R`)
- [x] Filter functions for feature filtering
- [x] Diversity calculation functions (`diversity_functions.R`)
- [x] Taxonomic functions (`taxonomic_functions.R`)
- [x] Import/Export functions (`import_functions.R`, `export_functions.R`)
- [x] Basic test suite for function-based components

### S3 Visualization Methods
- [x] Initial plotting function designs
- [x] S3 method pattern established for all visualization functions

## Current Progress

The hybrid approach implementation is approximately 75% complete. We have:

1. Established the core architecture
2. Implemented the majority of key functions
3. Created a test framework that works with the hybrid design
4. Added data import/export functions for interoperability

## Next Steps

Detailed implementation plans for Phase 3 are available in [implementation_plan_phase3.md](implementation_plan_phase3.md).

## Success Criteria

1. All core functions work with both FGTExperiment and SummarizedExperiment objects
2. Complete test suite passes with >80% coverage
3. Documentation clearly explains the hybrid approach benefits
4. Real-world validation confirms accuracy and performance
