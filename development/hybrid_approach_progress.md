# Hybrid Approach Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks our progress in implementing the hybrid approach for the microFGT package, which combines a minimal S4 class layer with function-centric design and S3 methods for visualization.

## Completed Components

### Core S4 Class Layer
- [x] Simplified `FGTExperiment` class definition
- [x] Basic constructor that extends TreeSummarizedExperiment
- [x] Essential accessor methods

### Function-Based Design
- [x] Transformation functions (`transform_functions.R`)
- [x] Filter functions for feature filtering
- [x] Diversity calculation functions (`diversity_functions.R`)
- [x] Taxonomic functions (`taxonomic_functions.R`)
- [x] Import/Export functions (`import_functions.R`, `export_functions.R`)
- [x] Basic test suite for function-based components

### S3 Visualization Methods
- [x] Initial plotting function designs
- [x] S3 method pattern established for all visualization functions

## Current Progress

The hybrid approach implementation is approximately 75% complete. We have:

1. Established the core architecture
2. Implemented the majority of key functions
3. Created a test framework that works with the hybrid design
4. Added data import/export functions for interoperability

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Core Functionality

#### Task 1.1: Data Import/Export Functions
- [x] Create universal import functions for common microbiome data formats
- [x] Implement export functions for results and data
- [x] Add conversion utilities to/from phyloseq, DADA2, etc.

#### Task 1.2: Advanced Analysis Functions
- [ ] Add differential abundance testing
- [ ] Implement community network analysis
- [ ] Create functions for microbiome biomarker detection

#### Task 1.3: Batch Processing Functions
- [ ] Add functions for processing multiple samples/cohorts
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and logging
- [ ] Develop parallelization options

### Priority 2: Documentation and Usability

#### Task 2.1: Update Package Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive vignettes showing the hybrid approach
- [ ] Update README and function documentation
- [ ] Add examples that work with both FGTExperiment and SummarizedExperiment

#### Task 2.2: User Interface Improvements
- [ ] Create wrapper functions for common analysis workflows
- [ ] Add progress bars and status reporting
- [ ] Implement data validation and quality control utilities

### Priority 3: Testing and Validation

#### Task 3.1: Expand Test Coverage
- [ ] Increase test coverage to >80%
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Create performance tests for larger datasets

#### Task 3.2: Real-World Validation
- [ ] Test with published FGT microbiome datasets
- [ ] Validate results against established methods
- [ ] Document benchmarking results

## Success Criteria

1. All core functions work with both FGTExperiment and SummarizedExperiment objects
2. Complete test suite passes with >80% coverage
3. Documentation clearly explains the hybrid approach benefits
4. Real-world validation confirms accuracy and performance
