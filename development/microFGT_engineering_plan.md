## Implementation Timeline

This implementation plan is designed to be executed iteratively, with each phase building upon the previous one. 

**Suggested timeline**:

- **Phase 1** (Foundation): 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2** (Code Quality): 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3** (Testing): 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 4** (Performance): 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5** (Documentation): 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 6** (Scientific Validation): 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 7** (Release & Maintenance): Ongoing

## Prioritization Guidelines

When implementing this plan, consider the following prioritization guidelines:

1. **Critical Path First**: Focus on items that block other work
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk areas early
3. **Quick Wins**: Implement easy high-impact items to build momentum
4. **User Impact**: Prioritize changes that directly improve user experience
5. **Technical Debt**: Balance new features with paying down technical debt

## Measuring Success

Each phase should include measurable objectives:

- **Code Quality**: % of files passing linting, test coverage %
- **Performance**: Execution time improvements, memory usage reductions
- **Documentation**: Completeness score, user feedback
- **Stability**: Number of reported bugs, time to resolve issues

## Conclusion

This engineering implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming microFGT into a high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly R package. By systematically addressing each area, the package will achieve a level of engineering excellence that ensures long-term sustainability and scientific validity.
