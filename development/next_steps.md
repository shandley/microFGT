- [ ] Add OS matrix (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Create badge for CI status

### 3. Code Quality Tools

- [ ] Set up lintr for static code analysis
- [ ] Configure styler for automated code formatting
- [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add R CMD check GitHub Action

### 4. Documentation Infrastructure

- [ ] Configure pkgdown for website generation
- [ ] Set up auto-deployment of documentation on release
- [ ] Create initial structure for vignettes
- [ ] Add badges for CRAN status, license, and coverage

## Short-term Goals (2-4 weeks)

### 5. Function Documentation

- [ ] Ensure all functions have complete roxygen documentation
- [ ] Add meaningful examples for each function
- [ ] Document edge cases and limitations
- [ ] Include parameter validation details

### 6. Testing Framework

- [ ] Expand unit test coverage (aim for >80%)
- [ ] Write tests for all exported functions
- [ ] Add tests for internal utility functions
- [ ] Test error conditions and edge cases

### 7. Class Design Improvements

- [ ] Review class hierarchy and relationships
- [ ] Implement proper validation methods
- [ ] Add coercion methods for compatibility
- [ ] Create comprehensive class documentation

### 8. Dependency Management

- [ ] Audit all dependencies and justify each
- [ ] Move non-essential packages to Suggests
- [ ] Implement graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies
- [ ] Specify minimum versions required

## Medium-term Goals (4-8 weeks)

### 9. Core Functionality Enhancement

- [ ] Implement additional community state typing methods
- [ ] Add more data transformation functions
- [ ] Develop more advanced visualization tools
- [ ] Create comprehensive data import/export capabilities

### 10. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Create benchmarking suite
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- [ ] Add parallel processing options

### 11. User Experience

- [ ] Implement progress reporting for long operations
- [ ] Add consistent messaging system
- [ ] Create meaningful error messages
- [ ] Add verbose mode for debugging

### 12. Vignettes

- [ ] Create "Getting Started" vignette
- [ ] Add workflow vignettes for common tasks
- [ ] Create advanced usage vignettes
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## Long-term Goals (2-3 months)

### 13. Scientific Validation

- [ ] Document statistical methods in detail
- [ ] Include citations for all implemented methods
- [ ] Validate results against reference implementations
- [ ] Document assumptions and limitations

### 14. Bioconductor Submission Preparation

- [ ] Ensure full compliance with Bioconductor guidelines
- [ ] Implement biocViews correctly
- [ ] Prepare for package review
- [ ] Create Bioconductor-style vignettes

### 15. Release Management

- [ ] Define semantic versioning policy
- [ ] Create release checklist
- [ ] Establish release schedule
- [ ] Configure automated release notes

## Implementation Approach

1. **Prioritize Critical Infrastructure**: First focus on CI/CD, testing, and documentation infrastructure to establish a solid development workflow.

2. **Iterative Development**: Work in 1-2 week sprints, focusing on completing specific items from the engineering plan.

3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing new features or fixing bugs.

4. **Regular Code Reviews**: Conduct code reviews for all significant changes to maintain code quality.

5. **Documentation as You Go**: Update documentation as features are implemented, rather than leaving it for later.

## Task Prioritization

When deciding which tasks to tackle first, consider:

1. **Critical Path Items**: Focus on items that block other work
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk areas early
3. **Quick Wins**: Implement easy high-impact items to build momentum
4. **User Impact**: Prioritize changes that directly improve user experience
5. **Technical Debt**: Balance new features with paying down technical debt

## Required Resources

- Developer time: Minimum 10 hours per week for steady progress
- Testing environment: Access to different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Example datasets: Examples of FGT microbiome data at different scales
- Domain expertise: Access to biology/microbiology expertise as needed

## Success Metrics

- Code coverage: Aim for >80% test coverage
- Documentation completeness: 100% of exported functions documented
- CI/CD stability: All tests pass on all platforms
- Performance benchmarks: Establish baselines and track improvements
