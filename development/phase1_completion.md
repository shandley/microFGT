# microFGT Engineering Plan: Phase 1 Completion

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure) of the microFGT engineering plan and outlines the next steps.

## Completed Items

### 1. Git Workflow Setup
- ✅ Defined branching strategy (main/develop with feature branches)
- ✅ Created develop branch for ongoing development
- ✅ Added comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
- ✅ Configured issue and PR templates
- ⏳ Branch protection to be set up in GitHub repository settings

### 2. Continuous Integration
- ✅ Set up GitHub Actions workflow for package checks
- ✅ Configured testing against multiple R versions (release, oldrel-1, devel)
- ✅ Added OS matrix (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ Created badges for CI status

### 3. Code Quality Tools
- ✅ Set up lintr for static code analysis with custom configuration
- ✅ Configured styler for automated code formatting
- ✅ Implemented pre-commit hooks via .pre-commit-config.yaml
- ✅ Added R CMD check and lint GitHub Actions

### 4. Documentation Infrastructure
- ✅ Configured pkgdown for website generation
- ✅ Set up auto-deployment of documentation on release
- ✅ Created initial structure for vignettes
- ✅ Added badges for status, license, and coverage

### 5. Code Organization (Phase 2 Item)
- ✅ Organized files by functional area
- ✅ Grouped files by functionality (core, data, utils, visualization)
- ✅ Consolidated example data functions
- ✅ Created constants directory

## Next Steps

Having completed Phase 1 and parts of Phase 2 of the engineering plan, the next priorities are:

### Immediate Focus (Phase 2 continuation)
1. **S4 Class Design**
   - Review class hierarchy and relationships
   - Implement proper validation methods
   - Add coercion methods for compatibility
   - Create comprehensive class documentation

2. **Function Design**
   - Ensure consistent parameter naming
   - Standardize return values
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add input validation to all functions

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Audit all dependencies and justify each
   - Move non-essential packages to Suggests
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies
   - Specify minimum versions required

### Short-term Focus (Phase 3)
1. **Testing Framework**
   - Achieve >80% code coverage
   - Write tests for all exported functions
   - Add tests for internal utility functions
   - Test error conditions and edge cases

## How to Contribute

The development branch (`develop`) now contains all the infrastructure improvements. Contributors should:

1. Fork the repository and create feature branches from `develop`
2. Follow the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch

## Project Status

The package is now set up with a solid development infrastructure, making it easier for contributors to maintain code quality and ensure consistent style. The pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines, and code organization will help maintain a high standard of code as the project progresses.

We've also completed substantial portions of the Phase 2 work related to code organization, which provides a strong foundation for the S4 class design and function design work that's coming next.
