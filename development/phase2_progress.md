# microFGT Engineering Plan: Phase 2 Progress Update

This document tracks the implementation progress for Phase 2 (Code Quality & Architecture) of the microFGT engineering plan.

## 2.1 Code Style & Organization ✅

All tasks in this section have been completed:

- ✅ Defined and documented naming conventions
- ✅ Organized files by functional area
- ✅ Applied consistent formatting to all files
- ✅ Reviewed and refactored internal helper functions
- ✅ Reduced code duplication across similar functionality
- ✅ Consolidated example data functions
- ✅ Moved constants to dedicated location
- ✅ Grouped files by functionality (core, data, utils, visualization)

## 2.2 S4 Class Design 🔄

Progress has been made on this section:

### Completed
- ✅ Consolidated duplicate class definitions into a single file
- ✅ Implemented proper validation methods using `setValidity()`
- ✅ Added coercion methods for compatibility (to/from SummarizedExperiment, TreeSummarizedExperiment, phyloseq)
- ✅ Standardized constructor (one primary constructor with comprehensive validation)

### In Progress
- 🔄 Enhancing documentation with inheritance diagrams

## 2.3 Function Design 🔄

Progress has been made on this section:

### Completed
- ✅ Created function design standards document with comprehensive guidelines
- ✅ Established parameter naming guidelines with clear examples

### In Progress
- 🔄 Implementing consistent error handling utilities
- 🔄 Standardizing return values
- 🔄 Applying input validation consistently

## 2.4 Dependency Management ⏳

This section is pending implementation:

- ⏳ Audit all dependencies and justify each
- ⏳ Move non-essential packages to Suggests
- ⏳ Implement graceful fallbacks for optional dependencies
- ⏳ Specify minimum versions required

## Implementation Updates

### S4 Class Design Implementation
- Consolidated all class definitions into `R/core/FGTExperiment-class.R`
- Added proper validation with `setValidity()` for class integrity
- Created a separate file for coercion methods in `R/core/FGTExperiment-coerce.R`
- Improved the main constructor with comprehensive validation and error handling
- Deprecated the duplicate constructor functions but maintained backward compatibility

### Function Design Implementation
- Created comprehensive `function_standards.md` document with:
  - Parameter naming conventions
  - Error handling standards
  - Return value patterns
  - Input validation requirements
  - Documentation guidelines

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete function design standardization:
   - Update key functions to use the new error handling utilities
   - Standardize return values across all functions
   - Apply consistent input validation

2. Start dependency management:
   - Audit all dependencies
   - Create documentation of dependency purposes
   - Begin moving non-essential packages to Suggests

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)
1. Complete all Phase 2 items
2. Begin Phase 3: Testing Framework
   - Set up codecov integration
   - Expand unit test coverage

## Success Metrics

Progress on Phase 2 is being measured by:

1. **S4 Classes**
   - ✅ Consolidated class definitions (100% complete)
   - ✅ Classes with proper validation (100% complete)
   - ✅ Coercion methods implemented (100% complete)

2. **Function Design**
   - ✅ Parameter naming guidelines (100% complete)
   - 🔄 Error handling implementation (~20% complete)
   - 🔄 Parameter validation coverage (~20% complete)

3. **Dependency Management**
   - ⏳ Dependency audit (0% complete)
   - ⏳ Optimization of imports vs. suggests (0% complete)

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made on the S4 class design portion of Phase 2, with the consolidation of class definitions, addition of proper validation, and implementation of coercion methods. The function design standards have been established with clear guidelines, but implementation across existing functions is still in progress. Dependency management work is scheduled to begin soon.

The most critical improvements so far include:
- Elimination of duplicate class definitions
- Addition of proper validation for improved reliability
- Implementation of coercion methods for better interoperability
- Standardization of design patterns for consistency
