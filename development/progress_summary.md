# microFGT Development Progress Summary

## Current Status

The microFGT package development has evolved from a complex S4 class-centric design to a more flexible hybrid approach that combines:

1. A minimal S4 class layer for Bioconductor compatibility
2. Function-based design for core functionality
3. S3 methods for visualization and common operations

This pivot has addressed several challenges we encountered with the pure S4 approach:
- Difficulty with exports and visibility of methods
- Complexity in testing S4 classes and methods
- Challenges extending complex Bioconductor classes

## Recently Completed Tasks

### Architecture

- Defined and documented the hybrid approach strategy
- Implemented minimal FGTExperiment S4 class
- Created function-based design pattern for all new functionality
- Established S3 method pattern for visualization

### Core Functionality

- **Import/Export Functions**:
  - Created flexible import functions that handle multiple data formats
  - Implemented export to various microbiome formats (BIOM, QIIME2, phyloseq, DADA2)
  - Added conversion utilities for seamless interoperability
  - Developed format detection and auto-correction features

- **Taxonomic Functions**:
  - Created standalone functions for taxonomic operations
  - Implemented aggregation at different taxonomic levels
  - Added utilities for normalizing and formatting taxonomy
  - Developed parsing tools for taxonomic strings

- **Diversity Functions**:
  - Implemented alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, etc.)
  - Added beta diversity calculations (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, UniFrac)
  - Created helper functions for distance calculations

- **Transformation Functions**:
  - Added count normalization functions
  - Implemented various data transformations (CLR, presence/absence, etc.)
  - Created filtering functions for low-abundance features

### Testing

- Built test suite compatible with the hybrid approach
- Created tests that work without relying on exports
- Added comprehensive tests for all new functionality
- Implemented tests for import/export functions

## Next Steps

1. **Advanced Analysis**: Implement differential abundance and other advanced methods
2. **Documentation**: Update vignettes and examples for the hybrid approach
3. **Testing**: Continue expanding test coverage
4. **User Interface**: Create wrapper functions for common workflows

## Timeline Assessment

The transition to a hybrid approach has allowed faster development progress after the initial learning curve. We are approximately:

- 100% complete on Phase 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure)
- 100% complete on Phase 2 (Code Quality & Architecture)
- 75% complete on Phase 3 (Core Functionality)

The hybrid approach has streamlined the implementation process and is expected to accelerate completion of the remaining phases.

## Recent Technical Decisions

1. **Function-First Design**: Prioritizing functional correctness over class hierarchy
2. **Universal Compatibility**: Making all functions work with any SummarizedExperiment-like object
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reducing the package's dependency footprint
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Adding specialized functionality for FGTExperiment objects while maintaining base compatibility with standard objects
5. **Format Flexibility**: Supporting multiple data formats for maximum interoperability

These decisions should significantly improve maintainability, testability, and user adoption.
