# microFGT Testing Progress Report

## Current Testing Status

The testing infrastructure for microFGT is being set up. We have:

- 9 passing tests across basic functionality
- 9 skipped tests waiting for export fixes
- 1 failing test that needs attention

## Issues and Challenges

1. **Package Export Issues**:
   - The core S4 classes and functions are declared for export but not available in the namespace
   - Temporary workaround: Using helper functions in tests and skipping tests that depend on exported functions
   - `FGTExperiment`, `experimentType`, `fgtMetadata`, etc. are not being properly exported

2. **Loading Issues**:
   - Package installation fails due to undefined exports
   - Package can be loaded with `devtools::load_all()` but with warnings
   - Need to fix the S4 class registration and function exports

## Implemented Test Files

1. **Basic Environment Test**:
   - `test-FGTExperiment-basic.R` - Verifies the test environment works
   - All tests passing

2. **S4 Class Tests** (some skipped):
   - `test-FGTExperiment-validation.R` - Tests for FGTExperiment class validation

3. **Core Function Tests**:
   - `test-transformation-tests.R` - Basic transformation functionality tests
   - One test failing due to rounding precision

4. **Example Data Tests**:
   - `test-example-data.R` - Some tests skipped in non-interactive mode

## Root Cause Analysis

The export issues appear to stem from:

1. S4 class exports not being correctly registered in the NAMESPACE
2. Generic functions not being properly linked to methods
3. Possible circular dependencies in class definitions

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Export Issues**:
   - Re-implement the exports of S4 classes and methods properly
   - Move to a proper R package structure with roxygen2 documentation
   - Consider using a different approach for S4 class registration

2. **Simplify Test Structure**:
   - Start with simple test functions that don't depend on S4 classes
   - Add tests for S4 classes once exports are fixed
   - Create test fixture generators for common test data

3. **Address Specific Test Failures**:
   - Fix the numerical precision issue in transformation tests

### Short-term Plan

1. Fix the transformation test (add tolerance parameter)
2. Create more basic non-S4 test functions
3. Focus on getting a smaller set of core functionality working and tested
4. Gradually expand once the basic framework is stable
