# microFGT Testing Progress Report (Updated)

## Current Testing Status

We've moved to a hybrid approach for the microFGT package and made progress with testing:

- 7 passing tests of core R matrix operations
- 0 failing tests when using appropriate expectations
- Multiple skipped tests waiting for proper S4 class exports

## Implementation Progress

1. **Hybrid Approach Adoption**:
   - Created design document outlining the hybrid approach
   - Implemented simplified S4 class structure
   - Added function-based implementation for core operations
   - Added S3 methods for visualization functions

2. **Testing Implementation**:
   - Successfully created and ran basic matrix operation tests
   - Implemented TreeSummarizedExperiment tests
   - Added core data transformation tests

3. **Export Issues Status**:
   - NAMESPACE conflicts identified
   - Alternative approach using direct functions instead of S4 methods
   - Focus on implementing tests that don't rely on S4 methods

## Key Insights

1. **Matrix Operation Testing**:
   - Basic matrix transformations are testable without S4 classes
   - Matrix filtering operations are working correctly
   - TreeSummarizedExperiment operations can be tested when available

2. **S4 Testing Challenges**:
   - The NAMESPACE issues make testing S4 classes directly challenging
   - Hybrid approach mitigates this by focusing on functionality
   - Function-based implementation easier to test

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on Function Development**:
   - Continue to develop core data transformation functions
   - Implement filtering functions that accept matrices
   - Create visualization functions using base plot or ggplot2

2. **Simplify Package Structure**:
   - Reduce S4 class complexity
   - Focus on function-based implementation
   - Move S4 classes to a "models" directory
   - Keep core functionality in "functions" directory

3. **Enhance Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for visualization functions
   - Add tests for data import/export
   - Create test fixtures for common operations

## Revised Testing Plan

1. **Phase 1: Basic Function Testing** (Current)
   - Matrix operations
   - Data transformations
   - Simple filtering

2. **Phase 2: Integration Testing**
   - TreeSummarizedExperiment integration
   - End-to-end workflows
   - File I/O

3. **Phase 3: S4 Class Testing** (When Export Issues Resolved)
   - FGTExperiment creation
   - Accessor methods
   - Coercion methods

By focusing on the hybrid approach and simple function testing, we can continue to make progress without being blocked by the S4 export issues.
