# Example Plots for microFGT

This directory contains example R scripts that generate visualizations showcasing the unique capabilities of the microFGT package. Each script is self-contained and demonstrates both practical and creative applications.

## Instructions

1. Ensure the microFGT package is installed
2. Create the directory structure if it doesn't exist:
```r
dir.create("inst/example_plots/images", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
```
3. Run each script individually to generate the plots
4. The plots will be saved in the `images` subdirectory

## Available Examples

### Practical Examples
