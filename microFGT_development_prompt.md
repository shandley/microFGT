# FGT Microbiome Analysis Package Development Initiative

## Project Overview
I'm developing an integrated R package for comprehensive analysis of female genital tract (FGT) microbiome data. This package will unify several specialized tools (dada2, phyloseq modernized with tidyverse principles, speciateIT, VALENCIA, and VIRGO) within a cohesive framework that handles both amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data.

## Core Requirements
1. Build upon TreeSummarizedExperiment (TreeSE) as the foundational data structure
2. Follow tidyverse design principles with pipe-compatible functions
3. Integrate FGT-specific analysis tools into a seamless workflow
4. Support both amplicon and metagenomic data analysis in a unified manner
5. Ensure compatibility with the broader Bioconductor ecosystem

## Development Tasks

### Initial Phase
1. Create the package skeleton with appropriate DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE, and documentation
2. Implement the core TreeSE-based data container
3. Develop conversion functions from common input formats (dada2, phyloseq) to TreeSE
4. Build basic data manipulation and transformation functions

### Tool Integration Phase
1. Implement R wrapper for speciateIT (C/C++ taxonomic classifier)
2. Create R implementation or reticulate wrapper for VALENCIA (community state typing)
3. Develop integration with VIRGO (vaginal gene catalog and analysis pipeline)
4. Create parsers to convert all tool outputs to TreeSE-compatible format

### Analysis Module Phase
1. Implement taxonomic analysis functions (filtering, aggregation, visualization)
2. Build community typing module with VALENCIA integration
3. Develop metagenomic analysis module with VIRGO integration
4. Create multi-omics integration module for correlating amplicon and metagenomic data

### API Design
1. Follow consistent verb-object function naming (e.g., `import_dada2()`, `assign_cst()`)
2. Ensure all functions are pipe-compatible (accept TreeSE object as first argument)
3. Design for both high-level workflows and low-level operations
4. Build for extensibility with modular components

## Technical Challenges to Address
- Efficient memory usage for large datasets
- Managing dependencies across multiple tools
- Optimizing performance bottlenecks
- Maintaining compatibility with evolving tools

## Initial Code Development Request
Please help me develop the foundation of this package by:

1. Creating a proper R package structure
2. Implementing core TreeSE-based data structures
3. Developing conversion functions from dada2 and phyloseq to TreeSE
4. Building basic data manipulation functions following tidyverse principles
5. Creating a proof-of-concept for one tool integration (preferably speciateIT)

When developing code, please ensure proper documentation, error handling, and adherence to R package development best practices. I'm particularly focused on creating a user-friendly API that follows modern R programming paradigms while providing the specialized functionality needed for FGT microbiome analysis.
