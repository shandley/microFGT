# microFGT Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented the initial phase of the microFGT package according to the development plan. The package now has a solid foundation with core functionality for handling FGT microbiome data, built on the TreeSummarizedExperiment data structure with tidyverse design principles.

## Implemented Features

### Package Structure

- Created complete R package structure with appropriate DESCRIPTION, documentation, and tests
- Set up directory structure for all components (R/, src/, tests/, vignettes/, etc.)
- Added LICENSE and README files

### Core Data Structures

- Implemented `FGTExperiment` class extending TreeSummarizedExperiment with:
  - Custom slots for experiment type and FGT-specific metadata
  - Accessors and methods for all slots
  - Show method for informative display

### Data Import and Conversion

- Created functions to import data from common formats:
  - `import_dada2()` for importing from dada2 output
  - `phyloseq_to_fgt()` for converting from phyloseq objects
- Added support for multi-omics integration with `create_multiomic_fgt()`

### Data Manipulation

- Implemented core data manipulation functions:
  - `filter_taxa()` for removing low-prevalence or low-abundance taxa
  - `transform_abundance()` for converting counts to relative abundance, CLR, etc.
  - `aggregate_taxa()` for summarizing at different taxonomic levels
- Created tidy data extraction functions:
  - `get_taxa_abundances()` and `get_sample_data()` that return tibbles

### Visualization

- Implemented basic visualization functions:
  - `plot_taxa_composition()` for stacked barplots of taxonomic composition
  - `plot_alpha_diversity()` for visualizing diversity metrics across groups

### Tool Integration

- Added proof-of-concept integration with speciateIT:
  - Functions to check for tool availability and database paths
  - Wrapper for command-line execution
  - Integration with the FGTExperiment object

### Performance Optimization

- Implemented C++ versions of core transformation functions:
  - Relative abundance calculation
  - CLR transformation
  - Log transformation
  - Presence/absence conversion

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive roxygen documentation for all functions
- Created introductory vignette with example workflow
- Included examples for all functions

## Testing

- Created unit tests for core functionality:
  - `FGTExperiment` constructor and accessors
  - Data filtering and transformation
  - Format conversion

## Next Steps

The initial phase of development is complete, and the foundation for further development is in place. The next steps will be to:

1. Complete the tool integration phase:
   - Add VALENCIA integration for community state typing
   - Implement VIRGO integration for metagenomic analysis

2. Develop analysis modules:
   - Add advanced taxonomic analysis functions
   - Build community typing module
   - Create multi-omics integration capabilities

3. Expand test coverage and add more vignettes

## Technical Notes

The package has been designed with:

- Bioconductor compatibility using S4 classes
- Tidyverse compatibility with pipe-friendly functions
- Performance optimization for large datasets using C++
- Clear documentation and examples to aid users
