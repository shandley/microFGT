"""Analysis layer — two tiers over the integrated object.

* **Primitives** (``transforms`` / ``diversity`` / ``diffabund``): validated commodity stats
  bought from scikit-bio, each mutating one modality in place (a layer, an ``obs`` column, a
  distance matrix). The compute wheels, not reinvented.
* **Hypothesis-test verbs** (``compare_alpha`` / ``compare_beta`` / …): the tests a researcher
  actually runs — "is this community feature associated with the variable I picked, adjusting
  for these covariates?" Each takes the object + which ``obs`` variables play which role + a
  subset, and returns a uniform :class:`~microfgt.analysis.results.AnalysisResult` (tidy table
  + headline stats + a declarative plot spec). That uniform return is the contract Layer 3
  (the dashboard) binds to, so the surface stays a thin presenter of the same calls a power
  user makes.
