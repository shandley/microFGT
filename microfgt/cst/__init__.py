"""CST layer — the ``classify_cst(composition, ...)`` interface, one blessed method.

CST is a single field standard: **VALENCIA**, ported as ``centroid`` and validated to
99.94% subCST agreement. It is not computed multiple ways and it is not competed against
rival classifiers — the community structure VALENCIA flattens is surfaced by *augmenting*
CST with interpretable descriptors (dominant taxon, % dominant, # taxa >10%), not by
swapping in alternative CST methods.

``register_method`` remains as a genuine extension point (e.g. a user's own centroid set or
a re-derivation), but ``centroid`` is the one method microFGT ships and blesses. There is no
namespacing and no per-method provenance stamp: with a single standard method there is
nothing to disambiguate.
