"""Assemble per-modality assays into one sample-keyed MuData (layer 1, the core object).

A MuData holds sample-keyed assays in one object: ``composition`` (**ASV x sample**, from
speciateIT — the source of truth, carrying sequences), its materialised taxon roll-up
``composition_taxon`` (taxon x sample, what CST and the descriptors read), and ``function``
(gene x sample, from VIRGO), with CST + augment descriptors + clinical variables as
sample-level annotations. This is the currency every later layer reads/writes.

**Honest sample reconciliation** (constraint B): we never silently drop or double-count
samples across assays. MuData keeps the *union* of sample ids; ``build_mudata`` reports
how the assays and the CST table overlap so mismatches surface instead of hiding.

A caveat the fixtures make concrete: ``prototype/real_fixtures/`` carries outputs from
three *different* tool repos whose sample ids do NOT match (``sample1...`` vs ``sub1/sub2``
vs ``1,2,...``) — they are not a co-assayed cohort. So these fixtures validate each
importer and exercise the assembly/reconciliation mechanics, but a true end-to-end
cross-modality integration needs a real co-assayed dataset (an open question in the spec).
