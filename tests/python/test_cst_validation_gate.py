"""P2 validation gate: centroid CST must reproduce VALENCIA on the published data.

Target (constraint B): >=99.9% subCST agreement vs the paper's own labels on the 13k
published samples. This needs VALENCIA's large published dataset
(``all_samples_taxonomic_composition_data.csv``, ~8 MB), which is NOT committed. Stage it
under ``.validation_data/`` (the helper script in ``validation/`` downloads it); the test
skips cleanly when it's absent so CI stays light, but the gate is fully reproducible.
